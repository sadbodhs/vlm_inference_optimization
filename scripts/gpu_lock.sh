# Exclusive GPU lock for anything that measures on this card.
# Copied from the CV study (sadbodhs/computer_vision_optimization) so both studies
# on this card honour ONE lock: same script, same lock path outside either repo.
#
# The 3090 is shared with other workloads, and this study measured what sharing
# does to a number: ~24% error, larger than most of the effects it reports. So
# benchmarks are serialised, never "balanced": one holder at a time, everyone
# else waits or goes away.
#
# The lock is a directory, because mkdir is atomic - two callers racing for it
# cannot both succeed. Inside it, an `owner` file says who holds it and why, so
# a stuck lock can be diagnosed instead of guessed at. It lives OUTSIDE the repo
# so unrelated projects on the same box can honour it too.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh acquire <name> [purpose]   # fail immediately if held
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh wait    <name> [purpose]   # block until free, then take it
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh release <name>             # only the holder named <name>
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh release --force            # break someone else's lock
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh status
#   scripts/gpu_lock.sh run <name> -- <cmd...>     # wait, run, always release
#
# Env: GPU_LOCK (default /home/suchi/sadbodh/.gpu-lock), GPU_LOCK_POLL (s, default 30)
